   of your shared files by updatedb.

2. Configure by editing cgi/findfilesconf.py.
   LIMIT: maximal number of records to output [example: 200]
   BASE_DIR: the root directory of your shared files
       [example: '/home/share']
   BASE_URL: the absolute or relative URL to access BASE_DIR
       [example: '/files']
   TIME_STYLE: format for file's last modification date
       [example: '%m/%d/%Y']

   DEDICATED_DB_FILE: whether DB_FILE only contins files under BASE_DIR
       [True or False]

3. Configure your http daemon.
